<h3>Modificare singole immagini</h3>

<i>GameMaker</i> ha un editor di imagini integrato che può essere usato
per modificare singole immagini degli sprite e i background. Per chiamare
l'editor per una subimmagine di uno sprite, seleziona quell'immagine
nell'editor di sprite e scegli <b>Edit Image</b> (Modifica Immagine) dal
menu <b>Image</b> (Immagine) (o fa' doppio click su di essa).
Per modificare un background, apri le proprietà del background e clicca su
<b>Edit Background</b> (Modifica Background).

<p>
L'editor di immagini integrato è abbastanza potente, specialmente per creare
sprite e background per <i>GameMaker</i>. Tuttavia, non ha tutte le funzioni
dei pacchetti di disegno completi. L'editor integrato è pensato principalmente
per applicare modifiche alle immagini, non per creare sprite e background dal
nulla. A questo scopo vorrai probabilmente usare un programma separato, salvare
le immagini come file PNG e caricarle in <i>GameMaker</i>. Puoi anche impostare
un editor di immagini esterno in Preferences.

<p>
Quando avvii l'editor di immagini, di solito somiglia a questo:

<p>
<img src="images/form_image_editor.jpg">

<p>
La finestra mostra l'immagine al centro e gli strumenti di disegno a sinistra.
Sotto puoi vedere le proprietà degli strumenti di disegno, che cambiano a seconda
dello strumento selezionato (vedi sotto). Al centro puoi vedere l'immagine corrente.
Puoi fare zoom avanti e indietro usando i pulsanti nella barra degli strumenti.
Sulla destra ci sono delle informazioni sui colori con cui stai disegnando. Puoi
scegliere colori separati per i bottoni sinistro e destro del mouse. Puoi cambiarli
cliccando con il bottone sinistro o destro sulla tavolozza o cliccando sulle caselle
innalto che rappresentano i colori.Sotto i colori puoi vedere l'Opacità. Indica quanto
opaco o trasparente deve essere il colore. Quando lo imposti a 255 i pixel che disegni
sono completamente opachi. Quando lo imposti a 0 sono completamente trasparenti.
Normalmente, quando disegni pixel parzialmente trasparenti, questi vengono mescolati
con il colore già presente. Impostando la Modalità Colore (Color Mode) su Sostituisci
(Replace), i pixel presenti verranno sostituiti con il nuovo colore. Infine in fondo
alla finestra c'è una barra di stato con alcune informazioni riguardo allo strumento
di disegno corrente, la posizione del mouse, la dimensione dell'immagine e l'ammontare
di memoria che richiede.

<h3>Drawing tools</h3>

<p>
The following drawing tools are available (from left to right, top to bottom).

<ul>
  <li><b>Paint.</b> 
    With this tool you can paint on the image. You can use the left or right mouse
	button to paint in the different colors. You can select the size of the pen.
	When holding &lt;Shift&gt; when starting to paint you only paint horizontal or
	vertical lines. When holding the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key you can select a new paint color.</li>
  <li><b>Spray.</b> 
    With this tool you can spray on the image. Spray is like paint except that you use a
	brush that is partially transparent at the sides. You can use the left or right mouse
	button to paint in the different colors. You can select the size of the brush. You can
	also select the hardness of the brush. A soft brush will be more transparent near the sides.
	When holding &lt;Shift&gt; when starting to spray you only paint horizontal or
	vertical lines. When holding the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key you can select a new spray color.</li>
  <li><b>Erase.</b> 
    With this tool you can erase part the image. It looks a lot like spray but you erase
	what is below the mouse. How much you erase depends on the the Opacity. For a value of
	255 you erase completely. For a smaller value you only make the image a bit more
	transparent. You can set the hardness of the eraser.
	When holding &lt;Shift&gt; when starting to spray you only paint horizontal or
	vertical lines.</li>
  <li><b>Color Picker.</b> 
    With this tool you can set the left or right mouse color to the color of a pixel in the
	image. Note that also the opacity value is set.</li>
  <li><b>Line.</b> 
    With this tool you can can draw straight lines.
	When holding &lt;Shift&gt; you can draw horizontal,	vertical, or diagonal lines. 
	You can set the width of the line and whether is should have arrows. By selecting <b>Anti-alias</b>
	the line is drawn with partially transparent pixels on the side to make it more smooth.</li>
  <li><b>Polygon.</b> 
    With this tool you can can draw a closed polygon. You click on the position of the first vertex.
	Next you can either drag the next vertex or click on the position of the next vertex. In this way
	you continue. You end the polygon with the &lt;Esc&gt; key.  
	When holding &lt;Shift&gt; you can draw horizontal,	vertical, or diagonal lines. 
	You can set the width of the line and whether the polygon should be filled or not.
	By selecting <b>Anti-alias</b>
	the polygon is drawn with partially transparent pixels on the side to make it more smooth.</li>
  <li><b>Rectangle.</b> 
    With this tool you can can draw a rectangle.   
	When holding &lt;Shift&gt; you can draw a square.
	When holding &lt;Ctrl&gt; you draw the rectangle from the center. 
	You can set the width of the line and whether the rectangle should be filled or not.
	By selecting <b>Anti-alias</b>
	the rectangle is drawn with partially transparent pixels on the side to make it more smooth.</li>
  <li><b>Ellipse.</b> 
    With this tool you can can draw an ellipse.   
	When holding &lt;Shift&gt; you can draw a circle. 
	When holding &lt;Ctrl&gt; you draw the ellipse from the center. 
	You can set the width of the line and whether the ellipse should be filled or not.
	By selecting <b>Anti-alias</b>
	the ellipse is drawn with partially transparent pixels on the side to make it more smooth.</li>
  <li><b>Rounded Rectangle.</b> 
    With this tool you can can draw a rounded rectangle.   
	When holding &lt;Shift&gt; you can draw a square. 
	When holding &lt;Ctrl&gt; you draw the rounded rectangle from the center. 
	You can set the width of the line and whether the rounded rectangle should be filled or not.
	By selecting <b>Anti-alias</b>
	the rounded rectangle is drawn with partially transparent pixels on the side to make it more smooth.</li>
  <li><b>Select Region.</b> 
    With this tool you can can select a rectangular region. You can extend the current selection by
	holding the &lt;Shift&gt; key. Also you can remove parts by holding the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key.
	Once you made a selection you can pick it up with the mouse and drag it to a new position. When you 
	use the right mouse button you make a copy. The selection can also be cut or copied to the 
	clipboard. It can be deleted with the  &lt;Del&gt; key. You can end the selection using the
	&lt;Esc&gt; key.</li>
  <li><b>Select with Magic Wand.</b> 
    In this case you make the selection by clicking on a pixel. All connected pixels with the same
	color will be selected. You can indicate the tolerance in color valu with which to select pixels
	and whether only the color or also the transparency value should match. You can extend the current selection by
	holding the &lt;Shift&gt; key. Also you can remove parts by holding the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key. You can
	manipulate the selection as above.</li>
  <li><b>Select by Spraying.</b> 
    In this case you make the selection by spraying with the mouse on the image. You can set the size
	of the selector. For the rest the selection can be treated as above. Different selection types
	can be combined.</li>
  <li><b>Text.</b> 
    To add a text click on the image. A pop-up window appears in which you
	can enter the text. Use the # symbol to insert a newline. Once you press
	<B>OK</B> the text is put in the image, with a box around it. You can now move
	the text by pressing with the mouse in the box and dragging the text. You can change
	the text by clicking with the right mouse button in the box. You can set the Font of the text
	and how the different lines should be alligned.</li>
  <li><b>Fill.</b> 
    Click on a pixel in the image and all connected pixels with the same color will be turned
	into the new pixel. You can set the tolerance with which the color should match. Also you can
	set whether to only match on the color value or also take the transparency value into account.
	Not that when the Color Mode is set to Blend the fill color is blended with the existing one. To 
	replace it, set the Color Mode to Replace.</li>
  <li><b>Change Color.</b> 
    Click on a pixel in the image and all pixels in the image with the same color will be turned
	into the new pixel. You can set the tolerance with which the color should match. Also you can
	set whether to only match on the color value or also take the transparency value into account.
	Not that when the Color Mode is set to Blend the new color is blended with the existing one. To 
	replace it, set the Color Mode to Replace.</li>
</ul>


<p>
<h3>Menus</h3>

A number of further commands is available through the menus. For some of these there is a corresponding
button on the tool bar.

<h4>File menu</h4>

<ul>
  <li><b>New.</b>
    Creates a new, empty image. You must indicate the size of the image. (When the image is part of
	a sprite with multiple images you cannot set the size.) 
	(Remember, all images in a sprite must have the same size.)</li>
  <li><b>Open.</b> 
    Open an image from a file. This menu item is not available when the image is part of
	a sprite with multiple images.</li>
  <li><b>Previous Image.</b> 
    Only available when the image is part of
	a sprite with multiple images. Saves the changes and opens the previous subimage.</li>
  <li><b>Next Image.</b> 
    Only available when the image is part of
	a sprite with multiple images. Saves the changes and opens the next subimage.</li>
  <li><b>Save as PNG File.</b> 
    Saves the image as a PNG file. No other file formats are supported.</li>
  <li><b>Close Saving Changes.</b> 
    Closes the form, saving the changes made to the image. If you don't 
	want to save the changes, click on the close button of the form.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Edit menu</h4>

Here you find the usual commands to Undo the last change and Redo the last undo, to delete, cut, or
copy the current selection to the clipboard, to paste the image on the clipboard as a selection
in the image, and to select all. (Note that when using the clipboard, transparency information might
be lost.) Two additional commands require a bit more explanation.

<ul>
  <li><b>Erase to Left Color.</b>
    This erases the image and replaces it by the left color (and opacity setting).</li>
  <li><b>Paste from File.</b>
    You can select an image from a file. This image is then pasted into the current image
	as a selection. You can then move that selection to the appropriate place.</li>
</ul>

<h4>View menu</h4>

<ul>
  <li><b>Zoom Out.</b>
    You can zoom out to see more of the image. You can also hold the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key
	and move the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in or out.</li>
  <li><b>No Zoom.</b>
   Sets the image back to the normal size.</li>
  <li><b>Zoom In.</b>
    You can zoom in to more precisely draw in an area of the image.</li>
  <li><b>Toggle Grid.</b> 
    You can toggle the grid on or off. Note that the grid is only shown when you 
	zoom in enough.</li>
 <li><b>Grid Options.</b> 
    Here you can set the size of the grid and the color. You can indicate whether to use exclusive
	or when drawing the grid (might make it more visible) and whether the drawing should be snapped
	to the grid.</li>
 <li><b>Show Preview.</b> 
    Show a preview of the image in the right bottom corner in the normal size. This is in particular
	useful when you are zooming in a lot to make small changes. If the image is larger than the preview
	are you can use the mouse to drag the part of the image you want to see. You can also double click
	on the preview image to open a separate preview window in which you can see the complete image.</li>
  <li><b>Set Tranparency Background.</b> 
    Here you can indicate how the transparent area of the image should be shown in the
	sprite editor. You can either use the (default) block pattern, or a color that you can change
	by clicking on the color box.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Transform menu</h4>

This menu contains the same transformation commands as in the sprite editor. You can read about
their function there. Note that <b>Resize Canvas</b>, <b>Stretch</b>, and <b>Crop</b> are not
available when the image is part of a sprite with multiple images, because in that case we
cannot change the size of the image.

<h4>Image menu</h4>

This menu contains the same commands as in the sprite editor. You can read about
their function there. Note that some commands are only available in the Standard Edition.
